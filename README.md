# WorkDayScheduler
Calendar application 

## Description
The calendar application allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). The user builds a schedule and displays the current day and time at the top of the screen. There are time blocks for each hour. The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Click the time block to enter an event or information. Then click the save button next to the time block. The text for the event is saved. When refreshed the events stay on the page. The user can remove the event and then save again and the event will stay deleted.
